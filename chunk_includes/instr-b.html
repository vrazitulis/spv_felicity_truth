    <p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We would like you to have a look at a few pictures and read sentences which relate to the pictures. After each presentation of a picture–sentence pair, you must answer a question about the sentence's relation to the picture.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>There are always two possible answers to choose from. To select an answer, press either the <b>D</b> key or the <b>K</b> key.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The question is the same for all sentences. It is always the following:<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Is this a true or a false description of the picture?</b><br><br>&nbsp;Answer option 1: <b>True</b> (D) – Answer option 2: <b>False</b> (K)<br>&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do not take too long to answer the question. Just follow your intuition about what you feel is correct.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li><p style="color:#0000FF"><b>It is very important that you concentrate and answer the questions as plausibly and accurately as you can. Please ensure that there are no distractions around you! :)<br>&nbsp;</b></p></li>
        <li>We will now walk you through a few practice examples. Only afterwards, the real experiment will begin.</li>
    </ul>
