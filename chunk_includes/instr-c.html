    <p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We would like you to read a few sentences. After each sentence, you must answer a question about it.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>There are always two possible answers to choose from. To select an answer, press either the <b>D</b> key or the <b>K</b> key.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The question is the same for all sentences. It is always the following:<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Is this a good or a bad statement?</b><br><br>&nbsp;Answer option 1: <b>Good</b> (D) â€“ Answer option 2: <b>Bad</b> (K)<br>&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do not take too long to answer the question. Just follow your intuition about what you feel is correct.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>We will now walk you through a few practice examples. Only afterwards, the real experiment will begin.</li>
    </ul>
